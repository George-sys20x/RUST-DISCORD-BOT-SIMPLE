This code creates a Discord bot using the discord crate, which you'll need to include in your Cargo.toml file. The bot will connect to the Discord server and listen for incoming events. When it receives a message event, it checks if the message content is "!ping" and responds with "Pong!" if it is.

To use this code, you'll need to replace "my_token" with your own Discord bot token. You can create a bot and get a token by following the instructions here.
